    <h2>Our Classes</h2>
    <div class="crossfit-class">
<h3>Crossfit</h3>
<p>These classes are constantly varied and use functional movements performed at high intensity.  They are designed to work on a broad set of skills, drills, strength and conditioning.  All classes can be scaled (meaning, anyone can do it!) and adapted to suit individual goals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="powerlifting-class">
      <h3>Power Lifting</h3>
      <p>The three lifts focused on are the squat, bench and deadlift.  We teach in-depth ways to improve upon these classic lifts and get stronger by optimizing position and using accessory tools to target weaknesses.  For optimum gains, members should try to attend three classes a week.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gymnastics">
      <h3>Gymnastics</h3>
      <p>Gymnastics is a huge component of CrossFit.  Various skills are taught with an emphasis on progressions to handstands and muscle ups, while building a strong core.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stretch-class">
      <h3>Stretch and Roll</h3>
      <p>Stretch, roll and improve flexibility. The class focuses on improving range of motion and positioning which will positively impact performance on lifts, gymnastic movements and everything you do in your day to day life.</p>
